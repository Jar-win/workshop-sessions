= Python, Introduction
Zilogic Systems

== Programming Fundamentals

=== Program

  * Sequence of instructions given to a computer to perform a task

  * Instructions
    - input
    - output
    - math
    - conditional execution
    - repetition

=== Programming

  * Breaking down a complex task into subtasks

  * Subtasks are further broken down

  * Until they can be implemented by a instruction

=== Python

  * Python - high level language

  * Computers understand low level language -- machine language

  * Advantages
    - Easier to write and maintain programs
    - Are not restricted to a single machine

=== Compiler vs Interpreter

  * Programs in high level language needs additional processing

  * Python programs are executed by an interpreter

image::figures/compiler-interpreter.png[width="50%",align="center"]

=== Python Interpreter

  * Interactive mode

  * Prompt: interpreter is ready to accept instructions
+
[source,python]
-----
>>> 1 + 1
2
-----
+
  * Operators: addition, multiplication, subtraction, division,
    exponentiation

=== Values and Types

  * Value: data that programs work with

  * Examples: `2`, `"Hello"`

  * Values can be classified based on their behaviour: class / types

  * Integer type: `2`, `5`, `10`

  * String type: `"Hello"`, `"Hello World!"`

=== Determining type

[source,python]
------
>>> type(2)
<class 'int'>
>>> type("Hello")
<class 'str'>
------

=== Types: `int` vs `str`

[source,python]
------
>>> 12 + 12
24
>>> "12" + "12"
'1212'
------

=== Printing Hello World

  * Python interpreter can be made to print `Hello, World!` using the
    following instruction

[source,python]
-------
>>> print('Hello, World!')
Hello, World!
-------

  * `print`, prints the value specified within parenthesis

  * More details will be provided shortly

== Expressions and Statements

=== Variables

  * Variable is a name that points to a value

  * Creating a variable: assignment statement
+
[source,python]
------
>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
>>> n = 17
------

=== Containing vs Pointing

  * Variables can thought of as, pointers in C / C++

  * They do not contain the value, rather they point to it
+
------
>>> message = 'Hello World'
>>> hello = message
------
+
  * There aren't two copies of 'Hello World'

  * A single copy with two pointers to it

FIXME: Image Here

=== Variable Names

  * Can contain alphabets, digits and underscore

  * Should start with alphabet or underscore

  * Underscore is used to separate words in the variable name:
    `source_file`, `server_hostname`

  * Invalid variable names result in syntax error

=== Invalid Variable Names

[source,python]
------
>>> 76trombones = 'big parade'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> more@ = 1000000
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
------

=== Keywords and Variable Names

  * Keywords: names reserved by the interpreter

  * Mean something special to the interpreter

  * Examples: `class`, `if`, `else`, `return`, etc.

  * Highlighted in the code editors, so need not be memorized!

=== Expression

  * Expressions are used to determine a value from other variables and
    values

  * A value by itself is a valid expression

  * A variable by itself is also a valid expression
+
[source,python]
-----
>>> 42
42
>>> n
17
>>> n + 25
42
-----

=== Statements

  * Statements are instructions to the interpreter

  * Assignment statement, instructs the interpreter to assign a value
    to a variable
+
[source,python]
-----
>>> n = 17
-----
+
  * Expressions can be part of statements
+
[source,python]
------
>>> n = n + 1
------

=== Statements (Contd.)

  * Expressions by themselves can be statements: expression statement
+
[source,python]
------
>>> n + 25
------
+
  * Result of expression statement is printed on the screen, by the
    interpreter

=== Script Mode

  * Interactive mode: statements are read from user and executed

  * Script mode: statements are read from a script file

  * Python scripts have a `.py` suffix

  * Bits of code can be tested in interactive mode, before it's used
    in a script

=== Script vs Interactive Mode

  * Interactive mode: Interpreter prints the value of expression
    statements
+
[source,python]
------
>>> miles = 26.2
>>> miles * 1.61
42.182
------
+
  * Script mode: Interpreter does not print the value of expression
    statements
+
[source,python]
------
miles = 26.2
print(miles * 1.61)
------

[role="two-column"]
=== Order of Operations

[role="left"]
[source,python]
------
>>> 1 + 2 ** 3
9
>>> 2 * 3 - 1
5
>>> 6 + 4 / 2
8
>>> 10 / 2 * 3
15
>>> 2 ** 3 ** 2
512
------

[role="right"]
  * BODMAS
    - Brackets
    - pOwer
    - Division, Multiplication
    - Addition, Subraction

  * Operator with same precedence, evaluated from left to right

  * Power, evaluated from right to left

=== String Operations

  * `+` operation between two strings: string concatentation

  * `*` operation between a string and integer: repetition
+
[source,python]
------
>>> first = 'throat'
>>> second = 'warbler'
>>> first + second
'throatwarbler'
>>> "Spam" * 3
'SpamSpamSpam'
------

=== String Operations (Contd.)

  * Representing repetition with `*` is a natural extension of
    addition

  * `4 * 3` => `4 + 4 + 4`

  * `"Spam" * 3` => `"Spam" + "Spam" + "Spam"`

=== Comments

  * Big and complicated programs can get difficult to read

  * Comments: notes added to program to explain the code in natural
    language

  * Comments start with a `#`

  * All characters after the `#` are ignored
+
[source,python]
------
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60

percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour
------

== Functions

=== Introduction

  * Sequence of statements that perform a computation

  * Name is assigned to the sequence of statements

  * Function can be invoked by its name

=== Defining a Function

[source,python]
------
def print_message():
    print("Hello World")
    print("Goodbye World")
------

  * `def` keyword specifies the start of a function definition

  * `print_message` specifies the name of the function

=== Defining a Function (Contd.)

[source,python]
------
def print_message():
    print("Hello World")
    print("Goodbye World")
------

  * Function definition has a header and a body

  * Header is the first line, ends with a colon

  * Body is indented, 4 spaces by convention

=== Returning from a Function

  * Function returns back to the caller when all statements are
    executed

  * Functions returns the value `None` by default

  * `None` is similar to `NULL` in C or `null` in Java

=== Defining Functions in Interactive Mode

  * In interactive mode, after the header, the interpreter prints a
    secondary prompt `...`

  * The body can be typed in the secondary prompt

  * An empty line terminates the body
+
[source,python]
------
>>> def print_message():
...    print("Hello World")
...    print("Goodbye World")
...
------

=== Function Parameters and Arguments

[source,python]
------
def print_twice(msg):
    print(msg)
    print(msg)
------

  * `msg` is a function parameter

  * When function is invoked it has to be passed one argument

  * Arguments are assigned to the parameter variables
+
[source,python]
------
>>> print_twice("Hello World!")
Hello World!
Hello World!
------

=== Local Variables

  * Variables created with a function are local

  * Parameters are also local variables

=== Returning Values

  * `return` statement can be used to return a value
+
[source,python]
------
def find_rectangle_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area
------

== Conditionals

=== Floor Division and Modulus

  * `/` operator, divides two integers, returns a fractional number
  
  * `//` operator, divides two integers and truncates the result to an
    integer, same as `/` is C

  * `%` operator, returns the remainder of the division
+
[source,python]
-------
>>> minutes = 105
>>> minutes / 60
1.75
>>> minutes // 60
1
>>> minutes % 60
45
-------

=== Relational Operators

  * Same as relation operators in C

  * Returns a boolean constant, `True` or `False`
+
[source,python]
-------
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 6
False
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
-------

=== Logical Operator

  * Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
  * Same as `&&`, `||`, `!` in C
+
[source,python]
------
>>> num = 5
>>> num > 0 and num < 10
True
------

=== Conditional Execution

[source,python]
------
if x > 0:
    printf('x is positive')
------

  * If condition evaluates to `True`, body is executed

  * Body is indented by one level, just like function definitions

=== Conditional Execution (Contd.)

[source,python]
------
if x % 2 == 0:
    print("x is even")
else:
    print("x is odd")
------

  * `else` can be used to specify code to be executed, when condition
    is `False`

=== Chained Conditionals

[source,python]
------
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greather than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
------

  * If there are separate actions to be taken on multiple conditions
    `if ... elif` ladder can be used

  * There is no statement similar to switch to Python

== List and Iteration

=== List

  * List is the equivalent of arrays in C
+
[source,python]
------
>>> fibo = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12]
>>> fibo[0]
1
>>> fibo[6]
8
>>> fibo[7] = 13
>>> fibo
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
------

=== Traversing a List

[source,python]
------
>>> for n in fibo:
...    print(n)
...
------

  * Loop body is executed once for element in the list `fibo`

  * `n` points to the current element, in the list

=== C-style `for` loop

[source,python]
------
>>> for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:
...    print(i)
...
>>> for i in range(10):
...    print(i)
...
------

  * Lists can be generated using `range()` function

  * This can be use for emulating C-style `for` loops

=== List Operations

[source,python]
------
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> a + b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
------

[source,python]
------
>>> [0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
------

=== Keyboard Input

  * `input()`, gets a line of input from the user

  * Accepts an optional prompt as argument
+
[source,python]
------
>>> name = input("Your Name? ")
Your Name? Guido Van Rossum
>>> name
'Guido Van Rossum'
------

=== Input a Number

  * Use `int()` to convert a string to an integer
+
[source,python]
-------
>>> num = input("Enter a number:")
>>> num = int(num)
-------

=== More Iteration

  * Python has `while` loop similar to C
+
[source,python]
------
sum = 0
while True:
   num = int(input("Enter your input:"))
   if num == 0:
      break
   sum = sum + num
print(sum)
------

== Misc. Bits

=== Global vs Local Variables

  * Variables created within functions are local variables

  * Variables created outside function are global variables

  * If variable created within a function needs to be global, use the
    `global` keyword
+
[source,python]
------
>>> def myfunc():
...    global gtest
...    gtest = 10
...
>>> myfunc()
>>> print(gtest)
------

=== Slice Operator

image::figures/slice.png[align="center",width="60%"]

[source,python]
------
>>> str = "Hello World"
>>> str[0:1]
'H'
>>> str[0:5]
'Hello'
>>> str[6:11]
'World'
------

=== Slice Operator (Contd.)

image::figures/slice.png[align="center",width="60%"]

[source,python]
------
>>> str[:5]
'Hello'
>>> str[6:]
'World'
>>> str[-2:]
'ld'
------

=== Default Arguments

  * An argument to a function can be made optional by specifying a
    default value

[source,python]
------
>>> def hello(name="World"):
...    print("Hello", name)
...
>>> hello()
------

=== Keyword Arguments

  * Arguments can be specified in a function call, by their parameter
    names

[source,python]
------
>>> def set_color(x, y, color):
...    print("x", x)
...    print("y", y)
...    print("color", color)
...
>>> set_color(color=1, x=2, y=3)
------
