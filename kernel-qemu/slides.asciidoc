=== Qemu, Introduction

[role="left"]

[role="right"]
  * Emulates a full system -- processor and peripherals

  * Can emulate various architectures including x86, ARM, SPARC,
    PowerPC

  * Operating Systems like Linux and Windows can be run within the
    emulated system

  * Useful for testing and developing Embedded Systems

  * Android emulator is a modified version of Qemu

=== ARM Emulation

[role="left"]

[role="right"]
  * Supported ARM SoCs include Exynos4210, PXA255, PXA270, OMAP2420,
    LM3S811

  * PXA270 based Verdex board plus add-ons from Gumstix, will be used
    for development

=== Qemu Architecture

=== User Mode Networking

  * When a packet is written to the Ethernet controller, Qemu looks
    into the IP and UDP/TCP payload

  * If packet is a TCP connection, Qemu opens a socket on the host
    system and connects to the specified IP

  * Payload from subsequent TCP packets for the connection, is
    extracted and written to the socket

  * Same applies for UDP packets as well

=== DHCP Server

[role="right"]
  * If a DHCP packet is received, then Qemu responds with an IP
    address

  * IP addresses: 10.0.2.15 - 10.0.2.31

[role="two-column"]
=== TFTP Server

[role="left"]

[role="right"]
  * TFTP is a simple UDP based protocol for file transfer

  * User mode networking implements a TFTP server

  * If a UDP packet is destined for 10.0.2.2, port 69, then the
    in-built TFTP server responds

  * Qemu's TFTP server should be provided with a directory to serve
    files from

== Verdex Emulation

[role="two-column"]
=== Verdex Board Components

  - SDRAM (128 MB)
  - NOR Flash (32 MB)
  - Serial: stdio
  - Ethernet: user mode networking
  - LCD: Web UI
  - I2C Keypad: Web UI
  - LEDs: Web UI

=== Invoking Qemu, without Web UI

------
qemu-system-arm -M verdex -pflash flash -m 256M -tftp tftpboot -serial mon:stdio
------

=== Memory Map

image::figures/memory-map.png[align="center",width="40%"]

=== Board Boot Sequence

  * The PXA270 processor, on reset starts executing instructions from
    `0x0`

  * The NOR Flash is located at base address `0x0`

  * U-Boot is located at offset `0x0` in the NOR Flash

  * So on reset, the processor starts executing U-Boot

  * U-Boot downloads the Kernel, Ramdisk and Device Tree Blob to RAM,
    from the host, using TFTP

  * U-Boot transfers control to the Kernel, and provides the location
    of the Ramdisk and Device Tree Blob to the kernel
