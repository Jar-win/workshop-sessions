== I2C and Device Tree

=== Background

  * I2C is a low speed serial bus

  * It is convenient over memory mapped access, since it is a serial
    bus with two signals, clock and data

  * Each peripheral connected to the bus is given a unique 7-bit
    address, hence a maximum of 127 devices can be connected

  * The device which provides clock is the master and all the other
    devices in the bus acts as a slave. Only the master can initiate a
    transaction

=== Device Tree

  * I2C controller node represents the I2C bus

  * I2C devices are represented as child nodes in the I2C bus
  
  * I2C controller properties
    - `#address-cells` is set to 1
    - `#size-cells` is set to 0

  * I2C device properties
    - `#reg` is set to the 7-bit address

=== I2C Keypad

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
zkey@30 {
    compatible = "zkey";
    reg = <0x30>;
    interrupts-extended = <&gpio 19 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};

[role="right"]
  * I2C address is `0x30`

  * Interrupt is generated to GPIO controller, pin 19

=== Try Out

  * First verify that the I2C Keypad device file is not present
  * Add the I2C device node to the device tree
  * Build and boot with the modified device tree
  * Ensure the keypad is now accessible
