Zilogic Systems

== Need for Device Tree

=== Boot-up in PC

  * In a PC, when the kernel boots up, the kernel can figure out
    address of basic peripherals
    - Either fixed
    - Can be queried from the BIOS

=== Boot-up in ARM

  * ARM SoCs are designed by variety of vendors
    - Differ in RAM base address
    - Differ in the peripheral controllers
    - Differ in the startup and initialization sequence
    - Information cannot be queried from a BIOS

  * In an ARM SoC, when the kernel boots up,
    - Does know the location of peripherals
    - Drivers required to handle the peripherals

=== Solution 1

  * For each SoC / machine, the kernel had board specific setup and
    initialization code

  * The available devices where hard coded into the kernel of each
    machine

  * Boot code will add them as platform devices, with the following
    information
    - Register Address
    - IRQ Numbers

  * Boot Sequence
    - Machine specific code does initialization
    - Required drivers using the platform device information

=== Problem with Solution 1

  * Did a good job of containing the problem to a certain extent

  * Still a lot of code duplication between SoC variants

  * Kernels had to be compiled for each target, and single kernel
    could not support multiple hardware

  * Lot of common code, that was not generalized into frameworks

=== Solution 2: Pure Data Driven Approach

  * In-memory tree-like data structure called the device tree provides
    information about the system

    - base address of RAM
    - available peripherals, and their base addresses

  * Data driven approach, forced lot of code to be converted to
    frameworks: `irq`, `pinctrl`, `gpio`, `clock`, `led`, etc.

  * And machine specific code were converted to drivers within these
    frameworks

  * Now, at boot-up a common code, queries the device tree to figure
    out details of the machine and invokes the appropriate drivers

== Device Tree History

=== Open Firmware

  * Open Firmware: a standard specifying the interface provided by a
    firmware

  * Developed by Sun, and widely used in Sun, Apple and IBM systems

  * Just like the BIOS, it is stored in a ROM, and is the first
    program to execute on power-up

=== Device Tree

  * Among the other things, Open Firmware specifies a way of providing
    device information through device trees

  * The device tree is constructed by the Open Firmware by probing the
    hardware

  * The program loaded by Open Firmware like a bootloader or an
    operating system can access the device tree, through the Client
    Interface

=== Device Tree in Linux

  * PowerPC and SPARC platforms commonly use Open Firmware

  * The Linux kernel on these platforms generally used Open Firmware
    to obtain the device tree

  * In 2005, it was made mandatory for all PowerPC ports to use the
    device tree

  * For those platforms that did not use Open Firmware for booting, a
    Flattened Device Tree representation has created

=== Device Tree in Linux (Contd)

  * "Flattened": passed to the kernel as blob, rather than being
    queried from the firmware at run-time.

  * Source representation called the Device Tree Source and files had
    the extension `.dts`.

  * Binary representation called the Device Tree Binary and files had
    the extension `.dtb`

=== Device Trees in ARM

  * In 2011, the ARM support for the Linux kernel was overflowing with
    patches and lots of copied and duplicated code with minor
    variations

  * The problem was covered in the LWN article at
    http://lwn.net/Articles/439314/

  * Gradually, all machines are being moved to use the device tree

------

[role="right"]
   * Multiple trees can be specified within a DTS file

   * Compiler will merge the trees into a single tree

   * Useful in combination with `/include/` directive for sharing
     common information

[role="two-column"]
=== Auto Merging

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
/dts-v1/;
/ {
    a {
        x = <10>;

[role="right"]
   * Multiple trees can be specified with a DTS file

   * Compiler will merge the trees into a single tree

   * Useful in combination with `/include/` directive for sharing
     common information

=== Sharing Common Information

  * `/include/` directive can be used to include files
+
------
/include/ "filename"
------
+
  * Device trees for two boards using the same SoC

  * SoC specific information is the same, but board specific
    information might differ

  * One SoC `.dtsi` file, contains the common device tree informartion

  * Separate `.dts` file for each board includes the SoC `.dtsi`

=== Try Out

  * Get
    link:{include:code/planets-v3.dts.datauri}["planets-v3.dts",filename="planets-v3.dts"],
    link:{include:code/inner.dtsi.datauri}["inner.dtsi",filename="inner.dtsi"]

  * Compile the `planets-v3.dts`

  * Compile and dump the DTB contents using `fdtdump`
+
------
fdtdump planets-v3.dtb
------
+
  * Observe that the two trees have been merged into a single tree

[role="left"]
image::figures/simple-dt-ref.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]

  * Sometimes it is necessary to refer to another node, in a nodes property

  * Useful to specify a relation between two nodes

  * For example, to represent the fact that the serial controller
    raises interrupt to a particular interrupt controller



[role="two-column"]
=== Labels

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/simple-v5.dts[]
------

[role="right"]
  * Each node can have a label in addition to a node name.

  * Labels should be unique throughout the DTS file

  * Labels can be used in other places to refer to the node

  * Labels can be referred using
    - Reference using strings
    - Reference using phandle

[role="two-column"]
=== Reference Using Strings

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/simple-v6.dts[]

=== Reference Using Phandles

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/simple-v7.dts[]
------

[role="right"]
  * A reference to a label within a cell array causes the following

    - A property `phandle` is added to the labelled node, with a
      unique numeric ID

    - Label reference in the cell array is replaced by the numeric ID

[role="two-column"]
=== Reference Using Phandles

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/simple-v7-expanded.dts[]
------

[role="right"]
  * A reference to a label within a cell array causes the following

    - A property `phandle` is added to the labelled node, with a
      unique numeric ID

    - Label reference is replaced by the numeric ID

=== Try Out

  * Get link:{include:code/simple-v7.dts.datauri}["simple-v7.dts",filename="simple-v7.dts"]

  * Add a label for node `a`

  * Add another property `path2` to node `c`, that references `a`
    using a phandle

  * Compile and dump the generated DTB

  * Observe the phandle property added to node `a` as well
