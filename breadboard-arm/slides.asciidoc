== Introduction

=== The Spectrum

=== ARM

=== Learning Embedded Systems

=== LPC1114

=== Goals

  * Goal 1: LED + Serial
    - Toggles a digital pin, every second
    - Transmits a message on the serial port
    - Connect an LED to the digital pin and observe state change
    - Connect serial port to a PC and receive the data
    
  * Goal 2: Reprogram the ARM micro
    - Download a new pre-built binary to the microcontroller

  * Goal 3: Custom Application Development
    - Write a custom program in C
    - Compile the program, and download the binary

== Goal 1: LED + Serial

=== Power Up

  * The microcontroller should be powered up first.

  * What are the various sources of power, for electronic devices?

=== Power Sources

  * Two major sources of power for electronic devices:
    - Battery
    - Wall Power

  * Each electronic device operates at a specific voltage.

  * What is the voltage requirement for LPC1114?

=== Battery

  * Commonly available battery is AA battery.

  * What is the voltage provided by the battery?

  * How can we get the voltage required to operate the LPC1114.

[role="right"]
  * Connect the power and ground, to the battery.

  * Verify that the pin `0_7` is toggling using a multimeter.

[role="right"]
  * Connect a Red LED with a 100 ohm current limiting resistor.

  * Does the LED toggle?

=== Characteristics of Power Sources

[role="left"]

[role="right"]

  * Two 3 pin sockets:
    - Bigger socket at the top
    - Smaller one at the bottom

  * Apart from the size, what's the difference?

[role="two-column"]
=== Water Sources

  * Same as the difference between a fire hose and water tap
  * The amount of water that can be delivered
  * In a power socket, the current that can be delivered

Caution: Drawing too much current than the power source can deliver, will burn
the power source!

=== Current Draw

  * How much current can be drawn from the IO pins?

  * The red LED has a forward voltage of 1.8V

  * What is the current draw in our circuit?

  * IO pins are designed for signalling rather than for providing
    power

=== Battery Capacity

  * How long will the microcontroller run before the battery drains
    out? This depends on two things.

    - How much charge is stored in the battery?

    - What is the total current draw of the circuit?

=== Battery vs Wall Power

  * Battery is generally used for mobile devices / remote devices

  * Device should have low power consumption for longer life

  * Rechargable batteries should be used to ensure continuous
    operation

  * Wall power is generally used for stationary devices

[role="two-column"]
=== Wall Power

[role="left"]
image::ac-adapter.jpg[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * One common AC adapter is the mobile phone charger.

  * Mobile phone chargers provide a 5V DC.
  
  * A 3.3V DC is required to operate the circuit

[role="right"]
  * Do you recognize the device?
  
  * Where is it used?

  * What is its purpose?

=== Voltage Regulator

[role="left"]

[role="right"]
  * A voltage regulator serves the same purpose for an electronic circuit

  * A 3.3 voltage regulator can takes a 5V input and provides a clean 3.3V
    output

  * Available for various fixed output voltages. We use LD1117V33

[role="two-column"]
=== Programming Micros

[role="left"]
image::programmer.jpg[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * Microcontroller used to have special programmers

  * Required to remove from the circuit for programming

  * Code is downloaded from the PC into micro, using the programmer

  * Modern microcontrollers have In-System Programming (ISP) support

=== How ISP Works

  * The micro has an internal boot ROM

  * When the ARM core is reset, the PC points to boot ROM

  * It starts executing instructions from boot ROM

  * The boot ROM has a boot loader

  * Bootloader reads the state of pin `0_1` (in LPC1114)

    - If high, executes code from Flash
    - If low, goes into ISP mode
    
  * In ISP mode receives code through serial port and stores in Flash

=== Automated ISP Entry

  * Serial comm. circuit can be used to perform ISP

  * Need to set `0_1` low, and reset the micro to enter ISP

  * Can be simplified by connecting `RST` and `0_1` of micro to `DTR`
    and `RTS` of FTDI

  * `DTR` and `RTS` are extra signals available for MODEM handshake

  * They can be controlled through host software

  * The code download software
    - Sets `RTS` low, to make `0_1` low (ISP enable)
    - Toggle `DTR`, to reset micro
    - Downloads the code
