== Preface

=== Limitations of Zepto

 * The project Zepto which has been developed previously, builds only
   3 software components and has further more recipes to create a
   rootfs image with it.

 * For a bigger embedded Linux projects these 3 components would not
   be sufficient and it may require us to write recipes for huge list
   of software.

 * The rootfs developed by our version Zepto creates a rootfs from the
   collective install location of our software. Which again would not
   be sufficient when we want to update the rootfs in runtime.

=== Need For Managed Rootfs

 * Assume that we have built the rootfs for a device which runs in a
   vehicle or deployed in a remote cellphone tower

 * If we want to update a bug fix for one of our software, we may need
   to do a FOTA.

 * Whether we need to ship the whole rootfs which is around a few MBs
   or want to ship only the particular software module.

=== Package Managed Rootfs

 * Managed Rootfs has to be built by installing software components as
   packages.

 * Each package has files to be installed on rootfs and metadata which
   describes about the package and its dependencies.

 * Rootfs has a package database, on installation of packages, the
   package db is updated.

 * Where we can install, remove & update packages and their
   dependencies without affecting rest of the rootfs.

=== Solution

[style="right"]
 * To address these issues developers of bitbake had developed recipes
   for many opensource projects and supportive infrastructure to
   create different filesystem images.

 * Bitbake developers grouped these recipes in meta layers and
   complete this build infrastructure was called as open-embedded
   build system.

=== History of Yocto

 * Poky & Angstrom are two embedded distribution which were built
   using open-embedded build system.

 * Poky was a build system used OpenedHand Project, After Intel taking
   over the OpenedHand project, Poky was adopted by Linux Foundation
   for its Yocto Project.

 * Yocto's goal was to provide complete development and test
   environment to the embedded Linux developers and vendor neutral
   collaboration environment.

== Introduction to Yocto

[style="two-column"]
=== What is Yocto

[style="right"]

 * Is an Umbrella project, involves developing build tools to
   facilitate building of custom distribution for the embedded devices.

 * More than build system, it focuses on complete build cycle
   involving compiling, debugging, testing on simulated hardware.

image::figures/yocto-project-transp.png[style="left",align="center"]

=== What is Yocto

 * Supports sufficient infrastructure to perform post build analysis
   on the build artifacts, for their size, dependency, quality and
   licenses.

 * Builds atomic layers to segregate and maintain software from
   different providers separately.

[style="two-column"]
=== Yocto Vs Buildroot

[style="right"]
  * Supports list of well tested open source software.

  * Allows building a managed rootfs with deb/rpm/ipk packages.

  * Provides a complete embedded development environment.

  * Well organized as layers and easily extendable

  * Allows testing software on emulators without a real target device.

image::figures/yocto-environment.png[style="left",align="center"]

=== Yocto internal projects

Yocto develops several projects to improve build infrastructure

 * Poky - reference build system

 * Autobuilder - build and test automation tool

 * ADT - Plugins for Eclipse/Anjuta IDE

 * Pseudo, cross-prelink - tools required to improve build

 * Hob & Toaster - UI tools to manage Yocto build and their results

 * Documentation - Detailed manuals to use Yocto for various embedded
   build scenarios.

 * Yocto project components are maintained in git repo
   https://git.yoctoproject.org/

[style="two-column"]
=== Poky

[style="right"]

 * Poky is an independent open source project, Yocto uses Poky as its
   reference system.

 * Yocto tests and provides the Poky build environment as part of its
   releases, which when built, provides Poky reference distribution by
   default.

 * Over openembedded build system, Poky builds SDK and debugger as IDE
   plugins, integrates QEMU for target simulation.

image::figures/Poky-Logo.jpg[style="left",align="center"]

=== OpenEmbedded

 * Openembedded is an independent project for embedded Linux build
   system.

 * Yocto and Openembedded share bitbake and a specific metadata(set of
   recipes) called openembedded-core.

 * Over openembedded community, Yocto ensures that oe-core meta-data
   are well-tested and inter-operable with platforms supported by
   Yocto.

 * Openembedded maintains bitbake and other recipes in
   http://cgit.openembedded.org/

 * New changes in bitbake and openembedded-core layers are merged
   first into open-embedded repository and later pulled by Poky repo.

== Working with Yocto

=== Setting up Yocto

 * Install dependencies for Yocto build

[source,shell]
----
 $ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends
            build-essential patch \
 	    diffstat git gawk chrpath \
            cpio texinfo libsdl-dev vim
----

 * Create a project directory and download Yocto

[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p yocto-project
$ cd yocto-project
$ wget -c \
  http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-1.8/poky-fido-13.0.0.tar.bz2
----

=== Setting Up Yocto (1)

 * Unpack the poky build environment as

[source,shell]
------
$ tar -x -f poky-fido-13.0.0.tar.bz2
$ cd poky-fido-13.0.0
$ ls
------

 * Extracted folder has bitbake, meta layers, scripts & oe-init
   scripts

 * Set up the yocto build environment by sourcing _oe-init-build-env_
   script file with your project name as argument.

[source,shell]
------
$ source oe-init-build-env
------

=== Setting Up Yocto (2)


 * The script creates and switches to a directory build, in which the
   further builds would happen

 * To start building, We should provide the target board (machine) for
   which the kernel and rootfs has to be built by Poky.

 * For our experiment we are going to use an arm target board emulated
   through QEMU.

 * Which can be configured by exporting a shell variable as shown
   below.

[source,shell]
------
$ export MACHINE=qemuarm
------

=== Managing Configurations in File

 * There are configurations other than MACHINE, which may need to be
   passed to the poky build environment.

 * Passing all required configurations through environment variables
   would be inconvenient.

 * And also the Poky accepts only limited configurations through
   environment variables.

 * To manage this the Poky provides a mechanism of passing
   configurations through file.

=== Managing Configurations in File

 * One such high level user manageable configuration file is
   local.conf

[source,shell]
------
$ nano build/conf/local.conf
------

 * Other parameters like number of threads to use, location for
   downloading the sources, etc., can be given through local.conf

=== Reducing Build Time

 * Since yocto build would take huge build space, build time and
   download bandwidth, it has facility to cache and reuse the build
   state and download directories

 * We can reuse the download dir and state-cache made available by us
   in /opt by adding below information to the
   build/conf/local.conf

------
DL_DIR = "/opt/downloads"
SSTATE_DIR = "/opt/sstate-cache"
------

=== Building Minimal Rootfs

 * To build the rootfs image, image name to be built has to be given
   as argument to bitbake.

 * core-image-minimal is a minimal console-only rootfs supported by
   poky and which can be built as shown below.

[source,shell]
------
$ bitbake core-image-minimal
------

 * Built kernel and rootfs images would be available in
   build/tmp/deploy/images/${MACHINE} directory.

 * Along with the images you may also find manifest files describing
   the packages available in rootfs.

=== Building Minimal Rootfs

 * The build should get completed in fewer minutes as it tries to
   reuse state-cache

 * After successful completion of the build the kernel image and
   rootfs images would be available in the tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm

[source,shell]
--------------
$ ls tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm/
--------------

 * The list of packages in rootfs can be read from manifest file

=== Booting Image with QEMU

 * Copy the zImage to shared folder /media/sf_share and
   core-image-minimal-qemuarm.ext4 as disk.img in /media/sf_share

 * Now we can boot our new images using qemu arm as shown

[source,shell]
------
$ ./runqemu.sh
------

=== Customizing the Build

* It is possible to customize the Poky build, to add a package to
  image or to exclude a package from the build through configuration.

* We can add a package to image by appending package name to he
  IMAGE_INSTALL variable.

* We can exclude a package from the build by appending the package
  name to PACKAGE_EXCLUDE variable.

=== Knowing Packages and Their Dependencies

* let's check the packages built in core-image-minimal by using -g
  option

[source,shell]
------
$ bitbake -g core-image-minimal
------

* Which generates a file named _pn-buildlist_ which has list of
  packages that would be built by core-image-minimal.

[source,shell]
------
$ nano pn-buildlist
------

* From this list we can find that, bash is not built by
  core-image-minimal recipe.

=== Adding Package to a Build

* We can enable building bash by adding below line to local.conf

------
IMAGE_INSTALL += bash
------

* Build the new rootfs image using core-image-minimal again and check
  whether the bash is built.

=== Need for Layer

* Any changes made in build/conf/local.conf is temporary and it cannot
  me maintained, shared or version controlled.

* Better practise is to maintain all our permanent changes in separate
  layer, which can be maintained in versioning system.

== Build Your Own Layer and Image

=== Tiny Rootfs

 * As an experiment we can try to build the rootfs, which we had built
   earlier with Zepto, now using yocto. This would involve,

 ** building bash, coreutils & less.

 ** building the ext formatted rootfs

=== Creating Our Own Meta Layer

 * The better practise while working with yocto, is creating your own
   layer to hold your changes

 * We can run the below command to create a layer called tiny-fs

[source,shell]
------
$ yocto-layer create tiny-fs
------

 * It prompts for various options which you can leave to default and
   this creates a directory meta-tiny-fs in the current directory.

 * We can find the layer.conf file inside the conf folder of
   meta-tiny-fs.

=== Need for Custom Image

 * As we know that Yocto expects that the list of packages to be built
   should be provided through a variable IMAGE_INSTALL through a
   recipe or conf file.

 * core-image-minimal.bb was packing in lots of packages into rootfs

 * for our tiny-fs, we need only three packages bash, coreutils and
   less. It is better to create our recipe to build rootfs image.

=== Creating Custom Image

 * Yocto provides core-image class which can be inherited to used
   already defined definitions to build rootfs image.

 * When we look on the layer.conf of our layer, we would find that the
   recipes are added to BBFILES from particular folder hierarchy.

------
BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb"
------

 * Sticking to Yocto's convention, we can create our image recipe
   named core-image-tiny.bb in meta-tiny-fs/recipes-core/images/
   folder

[source,shell]
------
$ mkdir -p meta-tiny-fs/recipes-core/images/
------

=== Knowing Supported Packages

 * The packages that are available in currently added layers can be
   obtained using

[source,shell]
----------
$ bitbake -s | grep -i bash
----------

 * From which we can get the package names for bash, coreutils and
   less.


=== Adding Packages to Recipe

 * In the image recipe file we can define the list of packages to be
   built into the rootfs image.

[source,shell]
------
$ vim meta-tiny-fs/recipes-core/images/core-image-tiny.bb


SUMMARY = "A tiny image just capable of allowing a device to boot."
IMAGE_INSTALL = " bash coreutils less "
IMAGE_FEATURES = "doc-pkgs"
inherit core-image
------

=== Adding Our Layer to Yocto

 * The new layer created has distro configuration and the core-image
   recipe.

 * The meta-tiny-fs layer has to be added to the yocto build as

[source,shell]
------
$ bitbake-layers add-layer meta-tiny-fs
------

=== High Level Configuration of the Build

 * At-last the configurations for the current build has to be updated
   to the `build/conf/local.conf`

 * For our build we may need to provide two information target MACHINE
   for which this build performed the and what is the DISTRO build
   policy should be adhered

 * We are going to build the rootfs for the qemu emulated arm target,
   which can be specified as `MACHINE = "qemuarm"`

 * By default the distribution is built using opkg packages which is
   openembedded's packaging format, we can override that by declaring
   the `PACKAGE_CLASSES` as `package_deb`

=== Minimal local.conf

 * The yocto expects the version of the current configuration to be
   provided using CONF_VERSION

[source,shell]
------
S nano conf/local.conf


MACHINE = "qemuarm"
DISTRO = "poky"
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_deb"
CONF_VERSION = "1"
------

=== Building Tiny-FS Image

 * Now we can start building the tiny-fs image by invoking

[source,shell]
--------
$ bitbake core-image-tiny
--------

 * The build should get completed in fewer minutes as it tries to
   reuse state-cache

 * After successful completion of the build the kernel image and
   rootfs images would be available in the
   tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qemuarm

=== Checking Our Tiny-FS Image

[source,shell]
--------------
$ ls tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qemuarm/
--------------

 * The list of packages in rootfs can be read from manifest file

[source,shell]
---------
$ nano tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm/core-image-tiny-qemuarm.rootfs.manifest
---------

=== Booting the Tiny-FS Image

 * Copy the zImage to shared folder /media/sf_share and
   core-image-tiny-qemuarm.ext4 as disk.img in /media/sf_share

 * Now we can boot our new images using qemu arm as shown

[source,shell]
------
$ ./runqemu.sh
------

=== Creating Our Own Distribution

 * By yocto convention, we may need to create a _distribution_ which has
   information about the policies to be adhered whiling building the
   individual components.

  * Distro configurations affects how the packages are configured and
    built rather than what packages are built.

  * Some of the distro configurations chooses how the system and
    packages has to be started in boot (sysv init or systemd)

  * Whether QT like UI components has to be compiled with X11 support
    or directfb support.

=== Creating Our Own Distribution

  * We can create a new distribution called tiny-distro in our meta-tiny-fs
    layer

  * Inside the meta-tiny-fs/conf create a directory distro and file
    tiny-distro.conf inside it. Write below given distro descriptions
    to it.

[source,shell]
------
$ vim meta-tiny-fs/conf/distro/tiny-distro.conf


DISTRO = "tiny-distro"
DISTRO_VERSION = "1.0"
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_deb"
------

=== Adding Our Distro to local.conf

 * Since we don't have big policies thought out for our tiny
   distribution, we can just choose a packaging method for our distro.

 * Can edit the conf/local.conf to build our new distro as shown below

[source,shell]
------
$ vim conf/local.conf


MACHINE = "qemuarm"
DISTRO = "tiny-distro"
CONF_VERSION = "1"
------

 * Build the image and test the new distro on the target.

== Things To Know

=== Package Groups

 * Poky allows to create special recipes which can build related group
   of packages.

 * Poky has several predefined packagegroups like
   packagegroup-core-boot, package-group-base etc.,

 * It is possible to create custom package group by inheriting
   packagegroup class and providing the list of packages in RDEPENDS

 * The packagegroup-core-eclipse-debug.bb available in
   meta/recipes-core/packagegroups/ is a fair example for a
   packagegroup.

=== Extending and Overriding Recipes

 * If already existing recipe has to be just modified for few
   parameters instead of writing the recipe again,

 * Just the newer modifications can be written in recipe file with
   extension '.bbappend' and sticking to file name as same as the main
   recipe.

 * Even if main and append recipes are placed in different layers,
   bitbake can resolve them.

 * One example we could find is
   _packagegroup-core-tools-profile.bbappend_ in
   _meta-yocto-bsp/recipes-core/packagegroups_ just adds two packages
   to RDEPENDS, whose main recipe _packagegroup-core-tools-profile.bb_
   is available in _meta/recipes-core/packagegroups_


=== Folders Structure for Build

 * The _tmp/work_ is the folder where all the packages are unpacked and
   built.

 * For each package we would find a folder inside target architecture
   folder.

 * In our build the target architecture is _armv5e-oe-linux-gnueabi_

 * The package build directory is available in

-------
   armv5e-oe-linux-gnueabi/${PN}/${PV}-${PR}
-------

 * The source is unpacked and patched in

------
   armv5e-oe-linux-gnueabi/${PN}/${PV}-${PR}/${PN}-${PV}
------

=== Folders for Package Creation

 * The packages are compiled in _build_ directory.

 * The compiled artifacts are installed in _package_ folder, then it
   is analyzed and segregated in _packages-split_ as development, doc
   and debug packages.

 * Metadata for building packages are available in _packagedata_
   folder.

=== Folders for Build Logs

 * A _temp_ folder inside the package folder would have build logs
   which can be referred on build failures.

 * We can find the details on build steps involved in building the
   package in file _log.task_order_

=== Need for Machine Configuration

  * _Machine_ is the target board for which the image is built.

  * The machine related configurations are available in
    conf/machine/{MACHINE}.conf file in a machine specific layer
    called as BSP layer.

  * BSP layer may also have form-factor configurations like display
    resolution, input devices to configure X11 features etc.

  * BSP layer would also have the Linux kernel compilation recipe,
    which would have default configuration for the target board.

=== Sample Machine Configuration

  * A minimal machine configuration file is given below

------
KERNEL_IMAGETYPE = "zImage"
SERIAL_CONSOLE = "115200 ttyAMA0"
MACHINE_FEATURES = "alsa bluetooth usbgadget"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel ?= "linux-yocto"
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto ?= "3.19%"
------

 * We can find a sample machine configuration file in
   _meta-yocto-bsp/conf/machine/edgerouter.conf_

=== SSTATE CACHE

 * Yocto creates hash map of the build environment of each recipe and
   archives the build artifact of the recipe in sstate-cache.

 * When we try to build again if the hash map generated for the recipe
   matched what already in exist state cache, the archived artifact is
   restored in the new build directory by setscene task.

 * We can find mostly _*setscene_ tasks in the build log.
