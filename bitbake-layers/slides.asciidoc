= BitBake with Layers
Zilogic Systems

== Layers

=== Overview

  * Layers are powerful feature of BitBake

  * It allows related meta data to be clumped together

  * Along with BitBake's other features, layers
    can extend / override meta data in other layers

=== Use Case: Recipe Collection

  * Layer provids a way of distributing a collection of recipes

  * Collection of recipes providing a feature, like GTK+ GUI, can be
    distributed as a layer

=== Use Case: BSP Support

  * Layer provies a way of adding support for a particular hardware

  * Recipes and configuration, to enable support for various
    hardware peripherals

=== Use Case: Customization

  * Important since, may layers are distributed by other vendors

  * Hard to convince a vendor to include a change, might not be
    applicable to all users

  * A mechanism is required to modify a layer, without directly
    changing it's source

  * A local custom layer, is used for this purpose
