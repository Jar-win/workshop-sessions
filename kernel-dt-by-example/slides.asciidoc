=== DTS for Machine v1

[source,dts]
------
include::code/v1.dts[]
------

  * `/memory` node specifies the memory range

  * `reg` property specifies the base address and size

=== DTS for Machine v1

[source,dts]
------
include::code/v1.dts[]
------

  * No. of cells for base address is specified by `#address-cells`
    property

  * No. of cells for size is specified by `#size-cells`

=== `reg` Property 

  * `reg` property is used by memory mapped peripherals to specify
    memory ranges used by the device

  * The parent of the node using `reg` property should indicate the
    no. of cells for base address and no. of cells for size

  * Multiple base address and size pairs can be specified in a single
    `reg` property

=== `device_type` Property

  * `device_type` is used to indicate that this node describes the memory

  * It is provided for compatibility with older device tree standards,
    used by some architectures

  * Current device tree standard, only requires that the node be named
    as `/memory`

=== Machine v2

=== Bus and Devices in DTS

[role="left"]
------
bus {
   device1 {
      ...
   }

   device2 {
      ...
   }
}
------

[role="right"]
  * Busses are represented by nodes with child nodes

  * Devices are represented by child nodes of the bus node

[role="two-column"]
=== DTS for Machine v2

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/v2/peripherals[]
------

[role="right"]
  * Memory mapped bus is represented by `/pxabus`

  * Memory mapped peripherals are represented as children of
    `/pxabus`

  * `compatible` property is used for matching the device with a
    driver

=== `compatible` Property

  * Can specify one or more names, more specific names should be
    specified first

  * Example with Micron M25P32
+
-----
compatible = "m25p32", "jedec,spi-nor";
-----
+
  * Flash supports JEDEC commands and additional M25P32 commands

  * OS will check for driver that supports M25P32 commands, by matching with name `m25p32`

  * If not, will check for a generic driver that supports JEDEC
    commands, by matching with name `jedec,spi-nor`

=== `simple-bus` Device & Driver

  * The bus is also a device that will be handled by a driver

  * The sole purpose of the driver for `simple-bus`, is to create and
    add platform devices, for the child nodes

=== Machine v3

image::figures/v3.png[align="center"]

=== DTS for Machine v3

[source,dts]
------
include::code/v3/interrupt-controller[]
------

  * Interrupt controller is just like any other memory mapped device

  * `interrupt-controller` property indicates that this node is an
    interrupt controller

=== DTS for Machine v3

[source,dts]
------
include::code/v3/interrupt-controller[]
------

  * Device nodes can refer to an interrupt controller

  * Can indicate that interrupt output signal is connected to an IRQ
    line of the interrupt controller

=== Interrupt Tree

image::figures/interrupt-tree.png[align="center"]

  * Interrupt tree should be represented in the device tree

  * Drivers require the IRQ no. to register interrupt handler

[role="two-column"]
=== DTS for Machine v3

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/v3/interrupt-property[]
------

[role="right"]
  * `interrupt-parent` indicates the interrupt controller to which
    interrupt output is connected
  
  * `interrupts` property indicates the IRQ numbers on the interrupt
    controller

  * No. of cells used to represent an interrupt is indicated by the
    `#interrupt-cells` property of the interrupt controller

[role="two-column"]
=== Interrupt Parent Inheritance

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
/dts-v1/;

/ {
    interrupt-parent = <&pxairq>;
    ...
    pxabus {
        ...
        uart@40100000 {
            ...
            interrupts = <22>;
        };
        timer@40a00000 {
            ...
            interrupts = <26>;
        };
    };
};
------

[role="right"]
  * If `interrupt-parent` is not specified in a node, it is
    recursively searched for in parent nodes

  * Useful to reduce repetition, specify once in the top-level node

=== Node Names

  * Node name convention
+
------
node-name@unit-address
------
+
  * `node-name`: 1 - 31 characters
    - `0-9 A-Z a-z [comma] [period] [underscore]
      [plus-sign] [dash]`

  * `unit-address`, the first address specified in the `reg` property

  * Nodes without `reg` property, `@unit-address` should be omitted

=== Node Names

  * Name of node should represent the function of the device

  * A list of recommend names is available from the device tree
    specification

  * An excerpt is provided below

    - `gpio`, `interrupt-controller`
    - `rtc`, `timer`, `watchdog`
    - `flash`, `disk`, `compact-flash`
    - `ethernet`, `serial`, `i2c`, `spi`

[role="two-column"]
=== Clock Controller

[role="left"]
image::figures/clock-tree.png[align="center"]

[role="right"]
  * All SoCs have a mechanism to enable / disable clocks to
    peripherals on the SoC

  * Clock gating is a basic mechanism of saving power in a CMOS
    circuit

  * Before a peripheral is accessed clocks to the peripheral needs to
    be enabled

=== Machine v4

image::figures/v4.png[align="center"]

=== DTS for Machine v4

[source,dts]
------
include::code/v4/clks[]
------

  * The clock controller is represented as device node

  * Will be referred to by device nodes that it provides clocks for

[role="two-column"]
=== DTS for Machine v4

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/v4/clocks-property[]
------

[role="right"]
  * `clocks` property specifies the clocks used by the peripheral

  * Specifies one ore more clock specifier

  * A clock specifier consists of clock controller node phandle and
    cells to identify the clock within the clock controller

  * No. of cells to identify the clock is specified by `#clocks-cells`
    property of the clock controller

=== Machine `compatible`

[source,dts]
------
include::code/v5/compatible[]
------

  * `compatible` property on the root node specifies the board / machine type

  * Used by the OS to do machine specific setup / initialization

  * Machine names should be specified with more specific machine first

  * OS will first look for setup code for machine type
    `gumstix,verdex` and if not found, will search for machine type
    `marvell,pxa270`.

=== Device Numbering

  * Serial port device names
    - `/dev/ttyS0`
    - `/dev/ttyS1`

  * `probe` function of driver is called when platform devices are
    instantiated and added to the platform bus

  * The devices can get different device names based on the `probe`
    order, which is unspecified by the kernel

  * Between bootup the names of serial ports can change!

[role="two-column"]
=== Device Naming with `aliases`

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/v6/aliases[]
    ...
------

[role="right"]
  * Device numbering can be controlled using `aliases`
  * `aliases` are used to specify the device numerbing
  * Each property specifies an alias

[role="two-column"]
=== Device Naming with `aliases`

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/v6/aliases[]
    ...
------

[role="right"]
  * Alias names have the following naming convention
+
------
<alias-name><id>
------
+
  * Example: `serial0`
    - `alias-name` is `serial`
    - `id` is `0`

[role="two-column"]
=== Device Naming with `aliases`

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/v6/aliases[]
    ...
------

[role="right"]
  * The value of the property is a string, representing the path to
    the device node

  * Can be specified as a string
    - `"/pxabus/uart@40100000"`
  
  * Or using phandles

=== Try Out

  * Replace the DTS file in the kernel source tree, build and boot

  * Check if the RTC device file `/dev/rtc0` is available. `hwclock`
    will fail

  * Add the RTC device node to the DTS file, build and boot
    - Register Region Base: `0x40900000`
    - Register Region Size: `0x3c`
    - IRQ Nos.: `30`, `31`

  * Check if the RTC device file `/dev/rtc0` is available. `hwclock`
    should work

[role="two-column"]
=== `cpus` node

[role="left"]
[source,dts]
------
include::code/v7/cpus[]
------

[role="right"]
  * Since the no. of cpus is only 1, `#address-cells` and
    `#size-cells` is set to `0`

  * `device_type` is used to indicate that the node is a CPU node, for
    backwards compatibility

=== Multi-core SoC: Broadcom BCM11351 

[source,dts]
------
cpus {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	enable-method = "brcm,bcm11351-cpu-method";

	cpu0: cpu@0 {
		device_type = "cpu";
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
		reg = <0>;
	};

	cpu1: cpu@1 {
		device_type = "cpu";
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
		secondary-boot-reg = <0x3500417c>;
		reg = <1>;
	};
};
------

== DTS Layering

=== Layering

  * DTS is not written as a single file

  * Rather broken down into multiple includable files, to share common
    DTS nodes

  * Simple Layering
    - DTS for SoC Family
    - DTS for SoC
    - DTS for Board

=== Layering for PXA27x

image::figures/dts-inheritance.png[align="center",width="75%"]

=== Device Status

  * Not all devices in a SoC is used on a machine / board

  * SoC DTS files add devices with `status` property set to `disabled`

  * Board DTS file enables the device by overriding the `status`
    property, setting it to `okay`

  * Device nodes with `status` property `disabled` will not be added
    as a platform device

=== Layered DTS

[source,dts]
------
include::code/layered.dts[]
------

=== C Preprocessor and Include

  * DTS files use a lot of numbers for IRQs, clocks, flags, etc.

  * To make the DTS more readable and maintainable, the kernel now
    uses macros instead of numbers

  * DTS has to be run through the C preprocessor to perform macro
    expansion

  * Also the macros are defined in header files

  * Hence DTS files now use, `#include` instead of the DTS include
    mechanism

=== Try Out

  * Replace the DTS file in the kernel source tree, build and boot
