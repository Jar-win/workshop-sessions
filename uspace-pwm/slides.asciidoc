== Digital Pulses  

[role="two-column"]
=== Pulse Train
[role="left"]
* For certain devices, digital IOs can be toggled to get desired
  output from them.

* To get a tone out of a buzzer, it needs to be switched `on` and
  `off` in certain frequency to get a musical tone.

* To control the brightness of a LED it needs to be switched on and
  off rapidly.

=== Pulsed GPIOs
[role="left"]
* The GPIOs can be pulsed high and low by controlling the delay
  between them.

* Instead of doing this in software, it can be delegated to a timer
  HW.

* For fine grained control of the device, we can change the high or
  low time of the signal, the `pulse width`.

== Pulse Width Modulation 

=== Overview

* The modulation is the way of mixing the useful data signals along with
  carrier medium which can be physically transmitted.

* The PWM is the way in which the width of the carrier waveform is
  varied, based on the information signal.


* Using PWM signal it is possible to generate analog variations with
  digital signals.

* The PWM signal can be used to control the power delivered to a load,
  by controlling the on-time of the PWM signal.

=== PWM in Detail

[role="left"]
* Period is the cycle time of the PWM signal which involves both on
  and off time.

* The `duty cycle` is defined as the ratio of on-time of the signal to
  the period of the signal.

* duty-cycle = (ON Time / Period) * 100

=== PWM Applications

* PWM signals are used to dynamically control the power generated from
  a source.

* PWM signals are generally used for motor speed control, LED
  brightness control, power supplies and wave form generation.

[role="two-column"]
=== PWM Controller

[role="left"]
* The hardware which can be configured to generate PWM signals is
  called as `PWM controller`. 

* The width of the signal generated by controller can be configured
  through software by modifying PWM registers.

=== PWM Controller

[role="left"]
* PWM controller resides in the memory bus of the SOC.

image::figures/pwm-arm.png[]

=== PWM Grouping

* Set of PWM signals are grouped into a single controller and as such
  there could be several PWM controler in a SOC.

* Each PWM signal in a PWM controller is called a `PWM channel`.

=== PWM in Linux

[role="left"]
* In Linux the PWM interfaces can be accessed from userspace
  application through sysfs.

* The access to sysfs goes to generic PWM driver, which inturn calls
  the processor specific PWM controller driver.

== Sysfs PWM

[role="two-column"]
=== Using PWMs with the sysfs interface

[role="left"]
* Inside `sysfs` in path '/sys/class/pwm` we have files which allows
  to control PWM channels.

* For each PWM controller a folder '/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip<base>' is
  created 

* where `base` is the base channel number for that controller.

[role="right"]
----

/sys/class/pwm/
| -- pwmchip<base>
     | -- pwm<no>
       	  | -- period
          | -- duty_cycle
          ` -- enable

[role="two-column"]
=== Using PWMs with the sysfs interface

[role="left"]
* For each channel in a PWM Chip we would find a directory
  `/sys/../pwmchip<base>/pwm<chno>`.

* Inside the channel directory we have files `period`, `duty_cycle` &
  `enable`.

[role="right"]
----

/sys/class/pwm/
| -- pwmchip<base>
     | -- pwm<no>
       	  | -- period
          | -- duty_cycle
          ` -- enable

== Peizo Buzzer

=== Buzzer Overview 

* It works on the inverse principle of peizo electric effect ie,
  `electrical energy` is converted into `mechanical energy`.

* When an oscillating digital signal is provided, the buzzer `stretch`
  or `compress`, producing sound.

* The `tone` of the sound can be modified by varying frequency of the
  signal.

* PWM can be interfaced to Buzzer to create varied tone.

=== PWM Channel Request

* The processor pins can be mapped for PWM channels through sysfs

----
$ echo 2 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip16/export
----

* You would find `/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip16/pwm2` available.

* PWM channel can be freed as shown below

----
$ echo 2 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip16/unexport
----

=== PWM Signal Control

* The period of the PWM can be controller as
----
$ echo 1000000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip16/pwm2/period
----

* The dutycyle can be updated as 
----
$ echo 500000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip16/pwm2/duty_cycle
----

* The PWM channel can be enabled / disabled as 
----
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip16/pwm2/enable

== DC Motor

=== Overview

[role="left"] 

* The `speed` of the DC Motor is proportional to the `supply` voltage
  provided to it.

* Speed control can be acheived by `varying` the average voltage
  delivered to the motor.

* The motor is rapidly switched on and off, where by controlling the
  on-time it is possible to control the speed of the motor.

* To control the speed of the DC-motors the voltage to the DC-motor
  has to be modulated through PWM signals.

* DC motor's speed and direction of rotation can be controlled varying
  the voltage levels and polarity.
